# WebApp-OpenIdConnect-DotNet

There's a newer version of this sample taking advantage of [Microsoft.Identity.Web]. Check it out:

- [Use OpenID Connect to sign in users to Microsoft identity platform and execute Microsoft Graph operations using incremental consent](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-aspnet-webapp-openidconnect)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the master branch, but please know that it's no longer maintained.
